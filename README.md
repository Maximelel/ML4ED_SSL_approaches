# Semi-Supervised Learning Approaches in Educational Contexts

Semester Project in the ML4ED (Machine Learning for Education) lab at EPFL

## 🌐 Overview

### 📚 Context

- **Rich Learning Data:** Witness the dramatic increase in data from technologically enhanced learning environments, providing a robust foundation for machine learning (ML) analysis.

### 🚧 Challenge

- **Labeling Hurdles in Education:** Grapple with the challenges of labeling large datasets in the educational context, demanding expert involvement and high pedagogical knowledge.

### ✨ Solution Proposed

- **Semi-Supervised Learning with Self-Training:** Explore the potential of self-learning, a semi-supervised approach that overcomes labeling challenges by leveraging small amounts of labeled data in multi-class text classification, specifically in the nuanced analysis of reflective writings. Understand how this methodology enhances the understanding and interpretation of these reflective texts.


## Research Question

Can semi-supervised approaches reduce human effort in labeling reflective writings?

## 📊 Methodology

- **Baseline with BERT Models:** Establish baselines for multi-class and binary classification on labeled reflection datasets.

- **Learning Curves Analysis:** Explore the influence of dataset size on model performance and confidence.
