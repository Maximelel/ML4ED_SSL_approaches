# Semi-Supervised Learning Approaches in Educational Contexts

Semester Project in the ML4ED (Machine Learning for Education) lab at EPFL (Sept. 2023 - Jan. 2024)

## 🌐 Overview

### 📚 Context: Reflective Writings of student teachers.

- **Educational Benefits of Reflective Writing:** Reflection on one’s performance through reflective writing offers substantial educational benefits.

- **Challenges in Reflective Writing:** Students need a very personnalized feedback from the educators and educators face complexities in teaching and assessing reflective writings.

- **ML and NLP Solutions:** ML and NLP offer potential solutions to challenges in reflective writing by automating the feedback provision.

### 🚧 Challenge

- **Labeling Hurdles in Education:** Grapple with the challenges of labeling large datasets in the educational context, demanding expert involvement and high pedagogical knowledge.

### ✨ Solution Proposed

- **Semi-Supervised Learning with Self-Training:** Explore the potential of self-learning, a semi-supervised approach that overcomes labeling challenges by leveraging small amounts of labeled data in multi-class text classification, specifically in the nuanced analysis of reflective writings.


## 🔍 Research Question

Can semi-supervised approaches reduce human effort in labeling reflective writings?

## 📊 Methodology

- **Baseline with BERT Models:** Establish baselines for multi-class and binary classification on labeled reflection datasets.

- **Learning Curves Analysis:** Explore the influence of dataset size on model performance and confidence.
